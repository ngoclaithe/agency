      "A business mentor of mine recommended Exiscale after I had major issues with my personal ad account getting shut down. I was a little hesitant to commit at first, because of the lack of face to face contact and the website seemed like it could easily be a scam. However ever since jumping in I was very impressed with the service. Their telegram support is virtually instantaneous and super on point! After using it for multiple months now, I can wholeheartedly recommend using exiscale if your in need of a third party ad account. These guys are legit üôè",

      "Honestly, I have PTSD from Facebook banning my profile and other accounts. It scared the crap out of me and has held me back from really pushing ads out. Exiscale has literally taken all that stress and worry away. I feel like things are about to skyrocket for me because I can run ads without worrying about not having a way to get things back up if Facebook decides to shut me down. Also the team and customer service is top tier, they reply to me in seconds!!! If you run Facebook ads, you‚Äôd be silly not to have Exiscale on your side!",
